# qPCR_snalysis_single_gene_calculator
This code works like a calculator to determine a fold change in gene expression in a sample of interest compared to control. It requires information on reference gene, target gene, control sample and test sample as an input and will give the fold change (+/- sd) with p-value (comparing dct for each sample) as an output. The csv file format for the data is as shown below. This is my first code; I did not use pandas at that time. Hence, this is based on column number and requires 'target section' in column 3, 'sample' in column 5 and 'ct' in column 6. After user provide required input, the information obtained on fold change and significant difference can be written on excel sheet that can be used for further analysis. The user will be asked if they want to analyze further data. If typed ‘y’ then users can analyze next set of data.

This code is very special to me as it is one of the reasons how I got interested in coding. Honestly speaking, as a biologist I had a feeling that computers and coding are not my cup of tea. As a graduate student at Mississippi State University, I took a course in computer science department (course biocomputing) as a requirement for computational biology certificate. The course required us to make an independent project. My PhD research was focused on gene expression, and I had to do a lot of qPCR analysis. For the analysis, I was using ddct method in R. However, I had to make code in R for each qPCR analysis. Writing code each time is time-consuming and prone to error. Hence, I wanted to make a code for my class project that would work like a calculator where I can put information on genes of interest and samples of interest, and it would give me an information on fold change and significant difference. I wanted to reduce my hours of workload in few minutes. The knowledge I gained during the class helped me to generate a code that made this possible. Now, qPCR analysis has become time-efficient and less error prone. I made power point for the project and presented in class. My husband looked at my power point and suggested to present it in a symposium. So, I did a poster presentation on this project in 16th annual Graduate Student Research Symposium, 2018 at Mississippi State University. Unexpectedly, I got a First place in Physical/Computational Sciences PhD Poster contest category. This changed my perspective toward myself and coding. It made me realize that with hard work and dedication we can achieve success in something that we originally felt not our cup of tea. So, thanks to biocomputing course at Mississippi State University and this code for encouraging me to explore the world of coding.
